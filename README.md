Using the app
-------------

To use or test this app simply load the index.html file in your browser. The porject was developed in Chrome but should be mostly compatible with other browsers due to the flexibility of the API I used and the jQuery library.

Features
--------

The map has built in Google features like:
+ zoom
+ street view
+ pan
+ satelite view

Additional custom features are:
+ markers for my favorite neighborhood locations
+ search/filter on location names
+ index list of all visible markers
+ display all markers option to reset map

When a marker is selected:
+ marker color changes
+ infowindow popup displays info on the location
+ up to four wikipedia links are displayed related to the location
+ the top flickr image hit is diaplyed


SUMMARY
-------

I hope you enjoy testing the map as much as I did. This project was very challenging but also very educational.
